- Flash menu _(ActionsScript 2)_
- Dynamic menu structure _(PHP)_
- XHTML content management _(Contribute)_

This projects seamlessly combines multiple technologies into one smooth package. The client creates and edits pages in a folder-structure of his choosing, while a PHP back-end generates a tree-structure for use by the Flash menu. The layout flips between full-Flash and Flash/HTML hybrid without navigating away from the page.
